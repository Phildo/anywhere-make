anywhere-make
==========

Convenience wrapper allowing interaction with makefile from anywhere in your source tree.

fup - searches up directory tree (note- UP, not DOWN) for file matching regular expression (passed in $1)
fmake - fup's for [Mm]akefile|MAKEFILE. if it finds a makefile, echos that file's location. if it gets to root, echo's error to stderr and exits 1.
amake - uses fmake to find makefile, passes all arguments to and calls make on that file
emake - uses fmake to find makefile, and opens it with $EDITOR
etodo - fup's for [Tt]odo|TODO. if it finds a file, opens it with $EDITOR. otherwise, prints to stderr and exits 1.

To install, put fup, fmake, amake, emake, and etodo anywhere on your path (/usr/local/bin), and then call any of these just as you would with make; 
now you can make your project from deep within some random directory. Hooray!
