anywhere-make
==========

Convenience wrapper allowing make to be called from anywhere in your source tree.
Simply passes calls to make up the directory tree until it finds a makefile. 

To install, put amake anywhere on your path (/usr/local/bin), and then call it just as you would with make; now you can make your project from deep within some random directory. Hooray!
