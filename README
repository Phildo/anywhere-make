anywhere-make
==========

Convenience wrapper allowing interaction with makefile from anywhere in your source tree.

fmake - searches up directory tree (note- UP, not DOWN), if it finds a makefile, echos that file's location. if it gets to root, echo's error to stderr and exits 1.
amake - uses fmake to find makefile, passes all arguments to and calls make on that file
vmake - uses fmake to find makefile, and opens it with vim (switching editors is as simple as changing the name in the file)

To install, put fmake, amake, and vmake anywhere on your path (/usr/local/bin), and then call any of these just as you would with make; 
now you can make your project from deep within some random directory. Hooray!
